•	1.1 GetDone provides the GetDone Platform to enable Posters to publish Posted Tasks.\n
\n•	1.2 Taskers may make an Offer in response to a Posted Task. Some parts of Offer details may be made publicly available, including to internet users who are not Users.
\n•	1.3 A Poster may revoke or modify a Posted Task at any time before he/she accepts an Offer. GetDone reserves the right to cancel all Offers on a Posted Task made prior to the modification.
\n•	1.4 If a Poster accepts an Offer on the GetDone Platform, a Task Contract is created between the Tasker and the Poster.
\n•	1.5 Upon creation of a Task Contract, the Poster must pay the Agreed Price into the Payment Account.
\n•	1.6 Upon creation of the Task Contract, GetDone has rendered GetDone Services and the Service Fee is due and payable.
\n•	1.7 Once the Task Contract is created, the Tasker and Poster may vary the Task Contract on the GetDone Platform. The Poster and Tasker are encouraged to use GetDone's private messaging system to amend or vary the Task Contract (including the Agreed Price) or to otherwise communicate.
\n•	1.8 Once the Services are complete, the Tasker must provide notice of that on the GetDone Platform.
\n•	1.9 Once the Services are complete, the Poster must provide notice of that on the GetDone Platform.
\n•	1.10 Once the Posted Task has been completed and the Poster confirms the Services are completed, or if GetDone is satisfied the Services have been completed, the Tasker Funds will be released by GetDone from the Payment Account to the Tasker.
\n•	1.11 After the Task Contract is completed, the parties are encouraged to review and provide feedback of the Services on the GetDone Platform.
\n•	1.12 GetDone may also provide a Search Assist feature enabling Posters to submit an Offer for Services.
\n•	1.13 An Offer submitted by a Poster using Search Assist may be notified to other Users and such Users may elect to make an Instant Claim of it.
\n•	1.14 When using Search Assist a Task Contract is created when a Tasker makes an Instant Claim.
\n•	1.15 A Poster may revoke or modify its Offer in using Search Assist at any time before a Tasker makes an Instant Claim. GetDone reserves the right to cancel all Posted Tasks made prior to the revocation or modification.

\n•	5.3 Cancellation of a Task Contract will be attributable to the Tasker where:
\no	(a) the Poster and the Tasker mutually agree to cancel the Task Contract; or
